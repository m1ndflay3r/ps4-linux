This is a fork of codedwrench's 5.15.y PS4 Linux kernel, with kernel preemption (realtime) enabled as well as USB sound modules.

To compile, run "make menuconfig", make any changes you may want, then hit exit to save. 

After this, just run make -j8 to start compilation.

Once done, move your build folder to /lib/modules with the exact name of your kernel (which you can find with "file /path/to/bzimage" on a non-running kernel).
  ex, "mv /home/someuser/ps4-linux /lib/modules/5.15.15-ps4-rt+"

create a symbolic link in your build folder, pointing to your build folder, called build. 
  ex, "ln -s /lib/modules/5.15.15-ps4-rt+ /lib/modules/5.15.15-ps4-rt+/build"

Congrats. You can now boot your kernel and use kernel modules, including through DKMS.

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
